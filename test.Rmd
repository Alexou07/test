For this project I have decided to take the Pew Research Center's evaluation of American opinions and make them visually captivating through the application of colorful data.


# Opinion

```{r approve, echo=FALSE}
dataset %>%
  filter(POL1DT_W53 %in% c("1", "2")) %>%
  mutate(POL1DT_W53 = ifelse(POL1DT_W53 == "1","Yes","No")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = POL1DT_W53, fill = POL1DT_W53)) + geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Opinion") +
  labs(title = "Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump \n is handling his job as President?",
       caption = "2019 Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel \n Wave 53 September 2019") +
  xlab("Opinion") +
  ylab("Count") +
