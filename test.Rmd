For this project I have decided to take the Pew Research Center's evaluation of American opinions and make them visually captivating through the application of colorful data.


## Opinion

```{r opinion, echo=FALSE}
dataset %>%
  filter(POL1DT_W53 %in% c("1", "2")) %>%
  mutate(POL1DT_W53 = as_factor(POL1DT_W53)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = POL1DT_W53, fill = POL1DT_W53)) + geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Opinion") +
  labs(title = "Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump \n is handling his job as President?",
       caption = "2019 Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel \n Wave 53 September 2019") +
  xlab("Opinion") +
  ylab("Count") +
  theme_classic()
```

## Approval
```{r approve, echo=FALSE}
dataset %>%
  select(POL1DT_W53, POL1DTSTR_W53) %>%
  filter(POL1DTSTR_W53 %in% c("1", "2")) %>%
  mutate(POL1DT_W53 = as_factor(POL1DT_W53),
         POL1DTSTR_W53 = as_factor(POL1DTSTR_W53)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = POL1DT_W53, fill = POL1DTSTR_W53)) + geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Approval") +
  labs(title = "Do you approve/disapprove of the way Donald Trump \n is handling his job as President?",
       caption = "2019 Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel \n Wave 53 September 2019") +
  xlab("Opinion") +
  ylab("Count") +
  theme_classic()
```
